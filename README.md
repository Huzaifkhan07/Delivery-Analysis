# Food-Delivery-App-Data-Analysis

This project involves working on a real-world food delivery app dataset to perform data analysis using **SQL** and **Python**. The objective was to gain valuable insights from the dataset by analyzing trends, patterns, and other useful information. Additionally, Python was used for data preprocessing to enhance performance for future tasks.

## Project Description

In this project, I analyzed a large database from a food delivery app. The goal was to extract maximum insights from the data and retrieve meaningful information using **SQL**. Data preprocessing was done using **Python** to ensure cleaner data for analysis, which helped improve performance and accuracy in further stages.

## Features

- Worked on a real-world dataset for data analysis.
- Used **SQL** to retrieve, analyze, and manipulate the data.
- Applied **Python** for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Extracted insights into customer behavior, order patterns, delivery times, and more.
- Developed useful queries to filter and aggregate data for better decision-making.
